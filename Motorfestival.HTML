        <h1>Motorfestival in Poland</h1>
        <h3>By Tom De Kroon</h3>
        <p>Every year in Łagów, there is a motorfestival.</p>
        <p>The festival lasts for 4 days, and motorcycle riders from all over Europe come to show and see other bikes.</p>
        <p>During the event, motorcycle riders from Europe meet new people, show or even sell their bikes, and some even try to race each other.</p>
        <h2>What is there to do?</h2>
        <p>There are many food trucks and other stands where you can buy various items.</p>
        <p>There is a big stage where bands play every night.</p>
        <p>On the festival grounds, there is a large campsite where you can stay for the duration of the event.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, there is a big parade where all the riders drive through the village.</p>
        <p>If you like bikes and cars, this is the place to be!</p>
        <h2>Staying here</h2>
        <p><strong>But be careful.</strong> Many places raise their prices during this event, and some are even closed.</p>
        <p>If you want to attend this event, the date is usually the second weekend of July.</p>
